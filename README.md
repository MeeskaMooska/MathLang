# MathLang
Written by. **Tayven Stover.**

### What is MathLang
MathLang is a programming language focused on one task: executing calculations with extreme precision.

### Notes to reader and future me.
I have no clue how to make my own language. I also have very little experience in C aside from the odd Hello World here and there. The reason I'm making MathLang is so that I can actually 
integrate my math learning into my personal passion (programming). When I started learning math, teachers would always provide real world examples to go along with math problems, 
as time went on though, we started doing math for what seemed to be just the sake of doing math. I am in college and taking math now, and I find it somewhat challenging to focus 
on math when I don't care about math. I've come up with the idea of using my passion for programming as a way of forcing myself to learn about math.
