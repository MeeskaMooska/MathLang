# MathLang Compiler Docs

### Uses:
As of now, the MathLang Compiler only supports the building of prewritten script and or programs into executables. Unfortunately, I do not ever plan to implement a terminal editor similar to pythons terminal interpereter.

Any flag must have a followed input, each flag used is **REQUIRED** to have a corresponding input. For example, if you enter two flags "-f" and "-o" the MathLang compiler will expect two corresponding values following each respective flag.

### Flags:
 - **-f:** The -f flag is used to specify the **.matlang** file that will be read in as source code.

 - **-o:** The -o flag is used to specify the name and location of the output file generated by the MathLang compiler.

 - **-p:** The -p flag is used to specify the platform that you intend to build your script for, if the -p flag is followed by a **"["** char, a list of values will be excepted, the "[" char must also be accompanied by a "]" char before the start of a new flag.
    - Please refer to this list of accepted platforms and the platform shortnames.
